          Yes! The Cloud was first sold as the cheap, convenient solution for backing up data, syncing our devices, and running apps from anywhere.
          Now though, cloud services are expensive, riddled with privacy issues, and constantly getting shutdown or made worse by the big companies who run them.

          It's time for something new.
          A growing community of engineers and developers have been building free and open-source apps to replace the cloud services sold by Big Tech.
          All you need to use these apps is a system that will host them in your own personal "cloud". Home Cloud makes this easy!
