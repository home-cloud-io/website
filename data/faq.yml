  - question: How can I port my app into Home Cloud?
    paragraphs:
      - Home Cloud runs a lightweight version of Kubernetes so it is compatible with any app that can be containerized. If you already distribute a Docker image of your app it will run just fine in Home Cloud.
      - Documentation is coming soon on how to write Home Cloud manifests for new apps but in the meantime you can check out examples in our App Store.
