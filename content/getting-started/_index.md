## Congratulations on your new Home Cloud device!

Let's walk you through setting up your new device. There's a few quick steps to complete to get things up and running.

### Step 1 - Unbox and check components

First, go ahead and unbox your device and make sure you have everything included in the box. You should have the following components included in the box:

1. **The Home Cloud device itself**

Got everything? If you're missing anything [please reach out to us](/contact) and we'll get it straightened out.

### Step 2 - Plug things in

Using the included ethernet cable, plug the Home Cloud device into your router. If you're not sure how to do this, you can follow steps 1-4 on [this guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Set-up-Ethernet). Also, feel free to [contact us](/contact) if you have any problems.

Now you can plug in the power adapter. Nothing complicated about this, just plug one end into the wall and the other into the barrel port on the back of the Home Cloud device. The device should immediately turn on (the light on the front will glow blue). If it doesn't, press the red power button to start it up.

**TIP**: Make sure to place your Home Cloud device where it has enough air circulation. All vents in the case should be clear of obstruction. We don't recommend placing it in a fully sealed off cupboard or small space as it may overheat.

### Step 3 - Set up the device

Home Cloud will take a few minutes to start. After waiting for this, access the setup page on the device to configure it: http://home-cloud.local/getting-started

**TIP**: If the page doesn't load on your phone, try opening it on your computer instead.

### Step 4 - Use the device

And you're done! Install your first app and enjoy your new Home Cloud!
